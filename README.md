# FindPathEngine
This is a library that implements the A* (A star) search algorithm. Is based on C++11 features.

## Why I need it.
1. Because I need to learn how the A* star algorithm works. There are other similar libs/implementations, but when you want to learn something is better, also, to write the code. 
2. Because I need it in my tests.
 
This is still somewhat a work in progress; it's stable, but there are probably places where can be improved.

## Licensing 
Public Domain. If my licensing is wrong, please let me know. Use at your own risk for whatever you want. Apparently licensing is hard and complicated. If your country doesn't have a public domain, feel free to say you found this on the side of the road.
